# Negative Selection Algorithm in Genetics
This is a Negative Selection Algorithm for Genetic Algorithm based on the Fisher's Iris Data. This is a modification of  silversword05's Python code based on the same dataset, with better documentation lol.
Run the data_split.py code to generate the input training and testing files. Then run the genetic_nsa.ipynb code to run the algorithm.
cheers!
